Root cause: Application running behind Kubernetes ingress/proxy where get_remote_address() returns same proxy IP for all clients, preventing rate limiting. Fixed client IP extraction with X-Forwarded-For headers but rate limiting still not functional in proxy environment. 2) ‚úÖ INPUT SANITIZATION FIXED - Enhanced dangerous pattern detection now blocks all 7/7 malicious payloads including SQL injection ('; DROP TABLE notes; --'), XSS scripts, and JavaScript injections. Legitimate encrypted content (base64, JWT, PGP) properly accepted. 3) ‚úÖ SECURITY HEADERS PERFECT - All 11 required headers present (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.). 4) ‚úÖ CORE FUNCTIONALITY INTACT - All 9/9 backend tests passed (secure notes, envelopes, TTL, delete-on-delivery).
